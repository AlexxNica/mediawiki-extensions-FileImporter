# FileImporter extension

This MediaWiki extension allows for the easy importing of a file from one site to another.
The word site is chosen specifically here as there is no reason code can not be written allowing the importing of Files from sites that are not MediaWiki wikis.

This extension has been created as part of the 2013 German Community Technical Wishlist https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T140462 where a wish requested that it be possible to "Correctly move files from Wikipedia to Commons" including file & description page history along with maintaining edit attribution & migrating templates.

Please also see the FileExporter extension which provides a link on the file pages of a MediaWiki site to link to a wiki that is running the FileImporter extension.
